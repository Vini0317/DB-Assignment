Answer 1: The "category_id" in the "Product" table serves as a foreign key referencing the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table. This establishes a relationship between the two entities.Since each product belongs to a specific category, this indicates a one-to-many (1:N) relationship between "Product_Category" and "Product" entities.This relationship allows for the categorization of products,                  making it easier to organize and manage them within the database. It also facilitates querying and reporting, as products can be grouped and analyzed based on their respective categories.

Answer 2: To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using a foreign key constraint:
           sql
           ALTER TABLE Product
           ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
           FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
           REFERENCES Product_Category(id);
